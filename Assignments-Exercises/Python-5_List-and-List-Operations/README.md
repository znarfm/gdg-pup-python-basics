### **Description**

In this assignment, you will work with lists in Python. You will practice creating a list, accessing elements, and performing basic operations like adding, removing, and sorting elements. This is a fundamental skill in Python, as lists are commonly used to store and manage collections of data.

### **Expected Output**

The program should:

1. Create a list of integers.
2. Add an element to the list.
3. Remove an element from the list.
4. Sort the list in ascending order.
5. Display the modified list after each operation.

Example output:

```
Original list: [5, 3, 8, 1]
List after adding an element: [5, 3, 8, 1, 6]
List after removing an element: [5, 3, 8, 6]
List after sorting: [3, 5, 6, 8]
```

### **Provided Files**

- `main.py` – The Python program that implements list operations.

### **Instructions**

1. **Program Goal**:
   - Write a Python program that creates a list of integers.
   - You will:
     - Access elements by their index.
     - Add an element to the list using the `append()` method.
     - Remove an element from the list using the `remove()` method.
     - Sort the list in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
2. **Steps**:
   - **Step 1**: Create a list of integers and print it to the screen.
     - Example list: `[5, 3, 8, 1]`.
   - **Step 2**: Add an integer (for example, `6`) to the list and print the updated list.
     - Use `list.append()` to add the element.
   - **Step 3**: Remove the first occurrence of an element (for example, `8`) from the list and print the updated list.
     - Use `list.remove()`.
   - **Step 4**: Sort the list in ascending order using `list.sort()` and print the sorted list.
3. **Test the Program**:
   - Try different numbers in the list and test your program to ensure each operation works correctly.
4. **Before Reviewing the Provided File**:
   - Try implementing the assignment on your own first.
   - Use the provided file (`main.py`) only as a reference after you’ve attempted your own solution.

### **Tips**

- Lists are ordered collections, and you can access elements using indices (e.g., `list[0]` for the first element).
- The `append()` method adds an element to the end of the list.
- The `remove()` method removes the first occurrence of a specific element in the list.
- The `sort()` method arranges the list in ascending order. You can also use `sorted()` to return a new sorted list without changing the original list.
- Try different list sizes and contents to explore various list operations.
