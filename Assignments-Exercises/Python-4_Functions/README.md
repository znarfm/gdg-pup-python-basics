# Functions Assignment - Create Greeting Function

## Description

In this assignment, you will create a simple Python function that generates a personalized greeting message. You will learn how to define a function, accept a parameter, and return a result.

---

## Expected Output

The function will create and return a greeting message in the following format:

```
The greeting message is: Hello Sparky, welcome to the GDG Web Development Team! You're doing great, and I truly believe that someday you'll be an amazing developer. Life may feel challenging right now, and programming can be overwhelming at times, but remember, all your hard work will pay off in the end. Keep pushing forward, you're on the right path!
```

## Provided Files

- `main.py` – The Python program containing the function definition for creating the greeting message.

---

## Instructions

1. **Program Goal**:  
   Write a Python function `create_greeting(name)` that:

   - Accepts one parameter: `name` (a string).
   - Returns a greeting message in the format: `"Hello, <name>!, welcome to the GDG Web Development Team! You're doing great, and I truly believe that someday you'll be an amazing developer. Life may feel challenging right now, and programming can be overwhelming at times, but remember, all your hard work will pay off in the end. Keep pushing forward, you're on the right path!"`.

2. **Task Breakdown**:

   - **Function**: `create_greeting(name)`
     - This function:
       - Accepts a single parameter: `name` (a string).

3. **Test the Function**:

   - In `main.py`, write code to:
     - Prompt the user to input their name.
     - Call the `create_greeting` function and display the returned greeting message.

4. **Error Handling**:

   - Ensure the `name` input is a string. If it’s not a valid string, display: `"Invalid input: Please enter a valid name."`

5. **File Structure**:

   - Save your program in a file named `main.py`.
   - Write clean and readable code with comments explaining each part.

6. **Before Reviewing the Provided File**:
   - Try implementing the program on your own first.
   - Use the provided file (`main.py`) only as a reference after you’ve attempted your own solution.

## Tips

- Use the `input()` function to get the user’s name.
- Use string formatting (e.g., `f"Hello, {name}!"`) to create the greeting message.
- Keep the code simple and easy to understand.
- Test your program by inputting different names to ensure it works correctly.
