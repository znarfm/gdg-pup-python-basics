# Python Assignment: Introduction to Python Syntax

## Description

This exercise helps you practice Python syntax by working with variables, data types, and basic operators. You will:

- Declare variables of different types.
- Perform arithmetic operations.
- Concatenate strings and display the output.
- Use the `type()` function to check the types of variables.

## Expected Output

```
Hello, Sparky!
Sum of age and height: 30.6
Product of age and height: 140.0
Type of name: <class 'str'>
Type of age: <class 'int'>
Type of height: <class 'float'>
Type of is_student: <class 'bool'>
```

## Provided Files

- `main.py` – The Python program that explores Python syntax.
- `README.md` – This README file.

## Instructions

1. Open the provided `assignment.py` file in your Python environment.
2. Run the file to see the output printed in the console.
3. Modify the variables (`name`, `age`, `height`, `is_student`) with your own values and observe how the program output changes.
4. Feel free to add more arithmetic operations or variables to explore Python's syntax further.

## Tips

- Make sure you understand the difference between the data types: `string`, `int`, `float`, and `boolean`.
- Use the `print()` function to output results to the console.
- Use the `type()` function to check the type of a variable, as demonstrated in the code.
